This is a humble effort to make a Neural network for deep learn.
One can train the categorical data with the Dense Layer and Activation functions.
For Activations ReLU and Softmax is used.
Categorical cross entropy used for loss.
Vannila SGD_optimizer used for backpropagation.
I used Physical_activity_prediction_Dataset from kaggle
